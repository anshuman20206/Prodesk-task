# Contributing to Prodesk

Thanks for wanting to contribute. Please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches (`feature/xyz`, `fix/issue-123`).
- Open clear, focused pull requests with descriptive titles.
- Run lints and tests (if present) before submitting.
- For significant changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

Code style
- Keep changes minimal and consistent with existing code style.

Documentation
- Update `README.md` and relevant `docs/` files when adding features or changing behavior.

Security & sensitive data
- Never commit secrets or credentials. Add them to `.env` and include `.env` in `.gitignore`.
